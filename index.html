        <p><scale>Lua is not an acronym; it is the Portuguese word for moon, so don't write it in all caps. Lua originates from
            Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where it was made by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes.
            They wrote language in 1993 and its intent was to be a scripting language. These people studied at PUC-Rio which its full name is the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. That same
            university maintains Lua.

        <p><scale>
            Lua at its core is an embeddable language. It prides itself on its expansive associative arrays which it calls tables.
            In terms of memory every variable has dynamic scope unless that variable is explicitly declare local in which that variable would be lexically scoped.
            That lexical scope is part of the original language as it is a specific keyword specified in the syntax of the language.
            Lua has a generational garbage collection system and dynamic typing. Lua is also object-oriented.

            Lua is used in game development, software, Data analysis, web development, and even academic research. Photoshop Lightroom is one
            notable software application that uses Lua. In terms of scripting languages Lua is fast. Which is likely why it has popularity it does.
